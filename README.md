## iTechMavenProject
## Maven - Build,Pack,Manage Dependency
## CountrySearch
* Used to find the country details getting input parameter as country code
* **mvn clean package** run this command where pom.xml is located. It will generate a jar file in target folder.
* Non executable jar - since it does not have Main class.
* If you give **mvn clean package**, Maven by default generates jar in target folder. In pom.xml no need to specify jar plugin.

## CountryProject
* This project is an example for invoking other project as a dependency jar.
* This project contains a Main class which is invoking the class CountryFinder in CountrySearch Project to get the details of the country.
* In pom.xml specify other project whichever you want to include as a dependency. For example
```xml
 <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.iamgirupa</groupId>
            <artifactId>CountrySearch</artifactId>
            <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
```
* We need to include, **maven-shade-plugin** to specify other project as dependencies
